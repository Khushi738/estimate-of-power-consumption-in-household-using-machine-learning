## Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to estimate and predict household power consumption. By analyzing historical power usage data, the model provides insights into consumption patterns and helps in optimizing energy use. Such predictions are valuable for both end-users and utility providers to manage and plan electricity usage efficiently.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical household power consumption records. If you wish to use a similar dataset, you can find one like **[Individual Household Electric Power Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption)** from the UCI repository.

### Key Features:
- **Global_active_power**: Household global active power consumption (in kilowatts).  
- **Global_reactive_power**: Household global reactive power consumption (in kilowatts).  
- **Voltage**: Voltage (in volts).  
- **Sub_metering_1, Sub_metering_2, Sub_metering_3**: Energy sub-metering values.  
- **Time and Date**: Timestamps for power consumption entries.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Normalize features for better model performance.
   - Generate time-based features (hour, day, season).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze power consumption trends over time.
   - Visualize correlations between features and target variable.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Train models such as:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest Regressor
     - Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBoost, LightGBM)
     - LSTM/GRU for time-series analysis.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ².

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the best model via a web interface or API to allow users to input their data and receive predictions.
